# Overview

Analyzers decode a chain of packets into a connection

Protocol analyzers use Dynamic Protocol Detection (DPD) to accelerate their confirmation

-DPD uses a unique signature to determine, quickly, what order to execute an analyzer in
	-regex based


# Analyzer Trees

An analyzer tree is associated with every connection. This tree can contain an arbitrary number of analyzers in various constellations and can be modified during the whole lifetime of a connection, i.e., we can enable/disable analyzers on the fly. Most importantly, this gives us two new capabilities:

# DPD Features

-Protocol analysis is independent of ports. By using a set of signatures which match typical protocol dialogues, bro is now able to look at payloads to find the correct analyzers. When such a signature matches, it turns on the corresponding analyzer.

-Analyzers can be turned off when it becomes obvious that they are parsing the wrong protocol. This allows us to use rather loose protocol signatures and, if in doubt, try multiple analyzers in parallel.

# Disabling Analyzers

Protocol does not exist on network segment at all, thus slowing down analysis

-Upstream shunting

-Extremely terse firewall rules

Encryptiojn protocol is the subject of analysis

-No means of decrypting protocol inline

Performance and resource limitations

-Syslog

-SNMP

# Usage

-Function prototype

global disable_analyzer: function(tag: Analyzer::Tag):
bool;

-Example

event bro_init()
{
	Analyser::disable_analyzer(Analyzer::ANALYZER_SYSLOG);
}
