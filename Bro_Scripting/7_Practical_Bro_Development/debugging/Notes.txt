# Other logs of interest

# Profiling log (prof.log)
-Turns on profiling of bro resource consumption
	-Profiling statistics
	@load policy/misc/profiling.bro

-Use case
	-Troubleshooting a sensor - Determine resource bounds

-Should not use on a production sensor at all times

-Should be part of a baseline exercise before sensor deployment

# Capture loss (capture_loss.log)
This script logs evidence regarding the degree to which the packet capture process suffers from measurement loss.
The loss could be due to overload on the host or NIC performing the packet capture or it could even be beyond the host.
If you are capturing from a switch with a SPAN port, it's very possible that the switch itself could be overloaded and dropping packets.
Reportied loss is computed in terms of the number of "gap events" (ACKs for a sequence number that's above a gap).

	@load policy/misc/capture-loss.bro

-Should not be used all the time on high bandwidth networks

# Resource Statistics (stats.log)
-Log memory/packet/lag statistics
@load policy/misc/stats.bro

-May be used on a high bandwidth network

-May be used to indicate additional behavior in your network as a side effect
