# SumStats

# Overview
-Summary statistics (otherwise referred to as SumStats) framework aims to define a mechanism for consuming unbounded data sets and making them measurable in practice on large clustered and non-clustered bro deployments.

-Bro's version of mapreduce

# Processing Flow

1. Observations, a single point of data. Observations have a few components of their own. They are part of an arbitrarily named observation stream, they have a key that is something the observation is about, and the actual observation itself.

2. Reducers, where observations are collected and measured, typically by taking some sort of summary statistic measurement like average or variance (among others).

3. Sumstats, where reducers have an epoch (time interval) that their measurements are performed over along with callbacks for monitoring thresholds or viewing the collected and measured data.


# SumStats Calculations
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Type                  Description
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SumStats::AVERAGE     Calculate the average of the values
SumStats::HLL_UNIQUE  Calculate the number of unique values. (HyperLogLog Algorithm)
SumStats::LAST        Keep the last X observations in a queue
SumStats::MAX         Find the maximum value
SumStats::MIN         Find the minimum value
SumStats::SAMPLE      Get uniquely distributed random samples from the observation stream
SumStats::VARIANCE    Calculate the variance of the values
SumStats::STD_DEV     Calculate the standard deviation of the values
SumStats::SUM         Calculate the sum of the values. For string values, this will be the number of strings
SumStats::TOPK        Keep a top-k list of values
SumStats::UNIQUE      Calculate the number of unique values

# Considerations

-Longer epochs, require longer retention of data
    -Minimize what's being tracked
    -Make the epoch an appropriate interval

-Data is retained in memory

-Will increase cluster communication

-Minimize the total number of SumStat instantiations
	-Understand your entire depoloyment profile
	-Evauluate SumStat artifacts overtime and determine their usefulness moving forward
