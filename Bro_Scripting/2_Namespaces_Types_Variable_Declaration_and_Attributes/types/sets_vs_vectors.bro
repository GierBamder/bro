#vectors should be used for collecting data with a defined order - the one you specify
# - note: allows for duplicated entries
#vector is a stack of paper that you keep adding onto
#
#sets do not allow for duplicated entries. A set is ordered and guaranteed to remain in a specific ordering. No matter what you add or remove (unless duplicate).
