# Directive: @FILENAME

-Expands to the filename of the current script.

Example:

print "File:", @FILENAME;


# Directive: @if / @else / @endif

-The specified expression must evaluate to type bool. If the value is true, then the following script lines, up to the next @else or @endif, are availabe to be executed.

@if (ver == 2)
    print "version 2 detected";
@else
    print "Defaulting to non-v2";
@endif

-Note: @endif is mandatory for closing an @if

# Directive: @load-plugin

-Activate a dymanic plugin with the specified plugin name.

-The specified plugin must be located in bro's plugin search path.

Example:
@load-plugin Training::SpecialProto

-By default, bro will automatically activate all dynamic plugins found in the plugin search path. The search path can be changed by setting the environment variable BRO_PLUGIN_PATH to a colon-separated list of directories.

-In bare mode ("bro -b"), dynamic plugins can be activated only by using @load-plugin, or by specifying the full plugin name on the bro command line (e.g., "bro Demo::Rot13"), or by setting the environment variable BRO_PLUGIN_ACTIVATE to a comma separated list of plugin names.

# Directive: @load-sigs

-This works similarly to "@load", except that in this case the filename represents a signature file (not a bro script). If the sig filename ends with ".sig", then you don't need to specify the file extension in the "@load-sigs" directive.

-The filename cannot contain any whitespace.

Example:
@load-sigs base/protocols/ssl/dpd

-Most often used with a protocol analyzer.

# Directive: @ifdef

-This works like @if, except that the result is true if the specified identifier is defined.

Example:
@ifdef (SOMESCRIPT::available)
    print "SOMESCRIPT::available ready";
@endif

-@else directives may be used with @ifdef


# Directive: @ifndef - "if not defined"

-This works exactly like @ifdef, exceept that the result is true if the specified identifier is not defined.

Example:
@ifndef (SOMESCRIPT::available)
    print "SOMESCRIPT::available is not";
@endif

@else directives may be used with ifndef
