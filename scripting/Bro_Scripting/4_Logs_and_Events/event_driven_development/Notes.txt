Bro is event driven by design

Events are asynchronous
-Events could arrive "out of order"

All execution in bro is defined by events

These always fire:

-event bro_init()

-event bro_done()

# Event-based Development
# See Event-based_Development1.png

-Network packets are reduced to events

-Protocol analyzers generate events

-Events are asynchronous callback mechanisms that must be registered for via the scripts engine


# Events may do anything with data passed
-Log
-Accumulate
-Set internal state that can be used in subsequent evnets
-Call external resources
-Call other events

# Declaration of an event:
global <name>: event(type+^);

-Note: An analyzer (SMB, HTTP, etc.) may raise an event, but an event does not have to be handled
