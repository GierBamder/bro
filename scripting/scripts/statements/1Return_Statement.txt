The return statement immediately exits the current function, hook, or even handler.

    For a function, the specified expression (if any) is evaluated and returned.

    A return statement in a hook or event handler cannot return a value bacause event handlers and hooks
    do not have return types. Treat a return, in this situation, as a short-circuit in the execution
    and a possible processing optimization - test early, return early.
